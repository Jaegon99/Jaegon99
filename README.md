   I'm a software developer and competitive programming enthusiast from Italy. 
   I currently work at Open Reply and I am studying for an MSc in Computer Science at the University of Milan.  
   My goals, for now, include delving into mobile development, machine learning and finding interesting opportunities to contribute to open-source projects.
